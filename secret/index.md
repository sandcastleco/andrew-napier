## Sledge

Trailer for Andrew's first feature film, made in 1996 when he was eight-years-old, and shot entirely in the basement of his childhood home in Mauston, Wisconsin. Notice the tasteful use of every single possible transition available, from "star" to "ripple dissolve," no Final Cut Pro transition went unused! The film itself has been hailed as "the single most influential film of the 90's" by Andrew's Mother.

**Synopsis:** After taking scientifically altered super steroids, Al Capone escapes from Alcatraz and, wielding a sledge hammer as his only weapon, he goes on a nation wide bank robbing spree wearing a ski mask. “Sledge” is born and the legendary prohibition agent Eliot Ness must go after him once again. Written, directed, edited, and starring Andrew Napier in the roles of both Al Capone and Eliot Ness. What a pompous little shit.
