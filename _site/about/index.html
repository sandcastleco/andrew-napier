    <p>Andrew Napier was born and raised in Wisconsin and attended the University of Wisconsin - Madison. In 2009, after working on Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> in Berlin, Germany, he moved to Los Angeles. Andrew was a producer of the 2012 Academy Award®-winning short film <em>Curfew</em>, and later edited its feature adaptation <em>Before I Disappear</em> (SXSW 2014 Audience Award Winner, IFC Films). His screenplay for <em>Dogtooth</em>, a remake of the Academy Award®-nominated Greek foreign film, is currently in development at Mandalay Pictures. Andrew directed the feature documentary <em>Mad as Hell</em> (Hot Docs 2014 Conscious Media Award Winner, Oscilloscope Laboratories), which follows Cenk Uygur, whose online news show <em>The Young Turks</em> has amassed over two billion views on YouTube. Andrew also directed the award-winning narrative short <em>Grandma’s Not A Toaster</em> (Tribeca 2013) and the feature documentary <em>Mary and Bill</em> (Wisconsin Film Festival 2011 Best Documentary).</p>

<p>Andrew produced and edited the acclaimed documentaries <em>The Past is a Grotesque Animal</em> (Sundance Now Doc Club, Oscilloscope Laboratories, 2014), about the band <em>of Montreal</em> and frontman Kevin Banes, and <em>Bounce: How the Ball Taught the World to Play</em> (SXSW 2015, Doc NYC). Andrew edited and executive produced the award-winning short film <em>Wasted Beauty</em> for producer Eva Longoria. Andrew co-produced the romantic comedy <em>Lust For Love</em> (2014), starring Fran Kranz and Dichen Lachman, served as an executive producer for the documentary <em>The Culture High</em>, and for the dark comedies <em>The Lord of Catan</em> starring Amy Acker, and <em>Limbo</em> starring H. Jon Benjamin.</p>

<p>Andrew has been making films since he was eight years old — from fictional action films about <a class="alt-link" href="/secret">Al Capone</a>, to documentaries about Native American burial effigy mounds, telling stories has always been his passion. After moving to LA, Andrew was first hired by the online news show <em>The Young Turks</em> where, as one of their earliest producers and directors, he was essential in helping build up the company into a massive success on YouTube. During his tenure at <em>The Young Turks</em>, Andrew independently followed and filmed Cenk Uygur (host and founder) as he transgressed from YouTube sensation to becoming a national television host on MSNBC and Current TV. This footage later became the film <em>Mad as Hell</em> which Andrew directed, produced and edited after he left the company. <em>Mad as Hell</em> was released by Oscilloscope Laboratories (film distributor founded by Beastie Boys member Adam Yauch) both theatrically and on all digital and VOD platforms Feb 6th, 2015.</p>
