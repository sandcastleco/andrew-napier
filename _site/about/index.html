    <p>Andrew Napier was born and raised in Wisconsin and attended the University of Wisconsin - Madison. In 2009, after working on Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> in Berlin, Germany, he moved to Los Angeles. Andrew was a producer of the 2012 Academy Award®-winning short film <em>Curfew</em>, and later edited its feature adaptation <em>Before I Disappear</em> (SXSW 2014 Audience Award Winner, IFC Films). His screenplay for <em>Dogtooth</em>, a remake of the Academy Award®-nominated Greek foreign film, is currently in development at Mandalay Pictures. Andrew directed the feature documentary <em>Mad as Hell</em> (Hot Docs 2014 Conscious Media Award Winner, Oscilloscope Laboratories), which follows Cenk Uygur, whose online news show <em>The Young Turks</em> has amassed over two billion views on YouTube. Andrew also directed the award-winning narrative short <em>Grandma’s Not A Toaster</em> (Tribeca 2013) and the feature documentary <em>Mary and Bill</em> (Wisconsin Film Festival 2011 Best Documentary).</p>

<p>Andrew produced and edited the acclaimed documentaries <em>The Past is a Grotesque Animal</em> (Sundance Now Doc Club, Oscilloscope Laboratories, 2014), about the band <em>of Montreal</em> and frontman Kevin Banes, and <em>Bounce: How the Ball Taught the World to Play</em> (SXSW 2015, Doc NYC). Andrew edited and executive produced the award-winning short film <em>Wasted Beauty</em> for producer Eva Longoria. Andrew co-produced the romantic comedy <em>Lust For Love</em> (2014), starring Fran Kranz and Dichen Lachman, served as an executive producer for the documentary <em>The Culture High</em>, and for the dark comedies <em>The Lord of Catan</em> starring Amy Acker, and <em>Limbo</em> starring H. Jon Benjamin.</p>

<p>Andrew has been making films since he was eight years old — from fictional action films about Al Capone, to documentaries about Native American burial effigy mounds, telling stories has always been his passion. After moving to LA, Andrew was first hired by the online news show <em>The Young Turks</em> where, as one of their earliest producers and directors, he was essential in helping build up the company into a massive success on YouTube. During his tenure at <em>The Young Turks</em>, Andrew independently followed and filmed Cenk Uygur (host and founder) as he transgressed from YouTube sensation to becoming a national television host on MSNBC and Current TV. This footage later became the film <em>Mad as Hell</em> which Andrew directed, produced and edited after he left the company. <em>Mad as Hell</em> was released by Oscilloscope Laboratories (film distributor founded by Beastie Boys member Adam Yauch) both theatrically and on all digital and VOD platforms Feb 6th, 2015.</p>
